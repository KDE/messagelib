 * @short An interface to body part reader link handlers
 * @author Marc Mutz <mutz@kde.org>
 *
 * This interface is a condensed of variant of the more general
 * @see URLHandler interface, designed to make bodypart-dependent
 * link operations possible without exposing KMail-internal
 * classes.
 *
 * Implementation-wise, these handlers are called as a nested
 * Chain Of Responsibilty by an internal implementation of
 * URLHandler.
 *
 * You can create a link whose handling is passed to this handler
 * by using BodyPart::makeLink( const QString & path ). \a path is
 * what * is passed back to the methods of this interface.
 *
 * Note that the BodyPart interface does not provide a means of
 * learning the content type of the body part passed. This is
 * intentional. It is expected that either separate
 * BodyPartURLHandlers are created for these purposes or else the
 * information encoded into the path parameter by the
 * BodyPartFormatter.
